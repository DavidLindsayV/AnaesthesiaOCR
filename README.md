# OCR for anaesthesia monitors

Optical Character Recognition for data acquisition from anaesthesia monitors (Industry Project)

Description
The purpose of this project is to develop an Optical Character Recognition Unit that can read data from anaesthesia monitor screens. A basic prototype that consists of a Raspberry Pi and Raspberry Pi Camera has been developed. This unit attaches to anaesthesia monitors and has been shown to be able to recognize the data displayed on an anaesthesia monitor display. Accuracy is however still wanting and various enhancements are desired.


Detail
This is a continuation of the 2022 ENGR301/302 project that developed the basic prototype unit. There are TWO aspects of the current system that are outstanding and would be the immediate desired outcomes of this project:

1. Enhancing the accuracy of the character recognition.

2. Identifying the two parameters that could be confused (Heart rate between 90 and 100bpm. and oxygen saturation that could be between 90 and 100%), maybe by identifying the parameter by the colour, or maybe by following the trend of previous values. e.g. previous values of >100 would make the parameter heart rate.

3. Achieve the above from multiple point of views, that is, the camera being placed in different angles/elevations in front of the monitor.

Student Capabilities
Knowledge of AI/ML for optical character recognition.

Suitable programming language for implementing AI/ML algorithms to improve the accuracy of the OCR.
